# Description
This application is for students at university who want to find other students to socialize
and save money. Users of this app, particularly students, can create an event in various
categories such as group work (studying, making models for projects etc.), sports (basketball,
football, tennis etc.), meals (ordering meals with someone to get a discount at different
restaurants), transportation (getting taxi with other people to pay less for transportation).
Having been created by students, events can be seen by other users of this application and
they can attend these events that have specific time-duration and place.

# Brief information
Until now, general structure of application was nearly complicated. The modules was defined and we began making project. Designing GUI(.xml files) was nearly complicated; however in the modules 
and GUI, there are some unclear and not complicated parts. In this week, we hope that we are going to handle with these part and make our code more effective.
